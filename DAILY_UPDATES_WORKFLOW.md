# Daily Updates Workflow

To maintain transparency and improve team collaboration, we will follow a habit of providing daily updates in the Slack channel. This will help everyone stay informed about ongoing tasks, upcoming plans, and any roadblocks that need attention.

## Update Format

Each team member should post their update using the following format:

### 1. What was done:
   - Summarize completed tasks for the day.

### 2. Plan for the next day:
   - Outline your goals for the following day.
   - If no tasks are planned for the next day, explicitly mention it.

### 3. Stuck Points:
   - Mention where you need help.
   - Specify the person responsible for providing support if applicable.

## Example Update

```
What was done:
- Resolved issue #4571.
- Implemented new dashboard filters.

Plan for tomorrow:
- Finalize QA for the dashboard release.

Stuck Points:
- Need clarification from @SOMEONE on the testing checklist.
```

## Notes
- Keep updates concise and relevant.
- Mention relevant team members if their input or action is required.
- Updates should be posted at the end of each working day.

By following this workflow, we can ensure smooth communication and better collaboration across the team.
